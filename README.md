# research-paper-abstract-simplifier

It is often difficult to find relevant information when a paper lacks structure. This project tries to hopefully makes it easier to understand the abstract of a paper by classifying and grouping the constituent sentences into Background, Objective, Methods, and Conclusion.


This project is still a work in progress.
The building of the model is underway, and it still lacks interactivity.
